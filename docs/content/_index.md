Minecraft Access is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) mod that specifically helps visually impaired players play Minecraft.
It is an integration and replacement for [a series of previous mods](https://github.com/accessible-minecraft).
This mod primarily borrows the help of a screen reader to describe (narrate) the game interface, and incorporates sound cues to provide orientation perception in this 3D world.
This mod supports [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) mod loaders on Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.
Currently, this mod [has enough features]({{% relref "/faq#is-the-mod-enough-to-play-the-game-normally" %}}) to help visually impaired players play the game normally.

Whenever the mod's code is updated, or whenever we need an upcoming feature someone contributed to be tested, a build will be automatically published in the [Playability Discord server](https://discord.gg/yQjjsDqWQX) first to allow for testing, after enough feedback has been gathered, the version will be released on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraft-access/versions), [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blind-accessibility/files), and [GitHub](https://github.com/minecraft-access/minecraft-access/releases).
